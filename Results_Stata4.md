## Part 1: Power calculations for individual-level randomization

- The optimal sample size would be 3142.
- The new sample size with 15% atrittion rates would be 3697.
- The new sample size when there are only 30% of the sample size in the treatment group is around 3800.

## Part 2: Power calculations for cluster randomization

- The power increases when the cluster size increase. I would recommend to use a cluster size of 1024 because it gives us a power of 90% which is the highest.
- The number of schools needed to get a power of 80% and a treatment effect of 0.2 is close to 1500.
- When 70% of the sample size get the treatment, the number of observations required to get 80% of power is close to 300.

## Part 3: De-biasing a parameter estimate using controls

- The means have a turning point and after that start to increase when sample size also increase
- In the case of the standard deviation, it decrease when the sample size increase.
