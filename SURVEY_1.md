# SurveyCTO Project
To conduct this survey I made some assumptions:
  - A program is being carried out to improve the educational level in rural areas of Peru.
  - The survey has been designed to be answered by pollster with the help of the respondent but not by the respondent by himself.
  - The departments of Lima and Piura were chosen as beneficiaries of the program.
  - The districts benefited by the program in each department were chosen randomly.
